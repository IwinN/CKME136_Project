Automated detection of IDC in breast cancer whole slide image patches using Convoluted Neural Network
Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is one of the most common types of breast cancer (~55% incidence rate).
The metastasis rate is extremely high with IDC cases. After biopsy, the cells have to be processed further
by the histopathologist to determine the presence or absence of abnormality and then, determine if it is
IDC or metastatic along with the grading the tumors. This is usually done by trained personnel for the
multiple cross sections of the biopsy, which is extremely time consuming. The final result is also heavily
dependent on the expertise of the histopathologist.
Deep learning can be of great help to automatically detect cancerous cells, classify them as metastatic or
IDC and improve the speed of detection. This could further be extended to make a web-based platform
where the original histology images could be uploaded and the results could be available instantly. This
could be of great use in situations where a wet lab to perform histopathological-analysis is limited in terms
of trained personnel.
Computer Aided Diagnosis have been used by clinicians to support clinical findings as a second opinion
confirmation since the 90s. In case of breast cancer detection, the observations made by histopathologists
can sometimes be in conflict and also subjective. CAD systems help to remove doubts in cases of non-
concordance between specialists.
